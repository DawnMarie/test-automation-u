Chapter 4 Loops Exercise
Roll the Die Game - The objective of this game is to travel the entire game board of 20 spaces within 5 die rolls.
* Roll the die for the user and advance the user that number of spaces on the game board.
* After each roll, tell the user which game space they are on and how many more spaces they have to go to win.
* Repeat this 4 additional times for 5 rolls in total.
* If the user gets to 20 before 5 rolls, they have won.
* If they are greater than or less than 20 spaces exactly, they lose.
* There are only 20 spaces on the board, so they cannot advance farther than that.
