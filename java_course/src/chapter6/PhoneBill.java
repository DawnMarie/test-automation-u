Chapter 6 Objects Exercise
Calculate the necessary numbers for someone's cell phone bill.
* Charge the user .25 for every minute they were over plan, and 15% tax on that subtotal.
* Create separate methods to calculate the tax, overage fees, and final total.
* Constructors should include default, id-only, all fields. No matter which constructor is used, all fields should be set.
